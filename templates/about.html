    <h1>Welcome to Burger King</h1>
    <p>
      At Burger King, we pride ourselves on serving high-quality, great-tasting,
      and affordable food to our customers. Since our humble beginnings in 1954,
      we have grown to become the second-largest fast food hamburger chain in
      the world. With more than 18,000 locations in over 100 countries and U.S.
      territories, we are committed to providing exceptional customer service
      and delicious meals that keep our guests coming back for more.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Burger King was founded in 1954 by James McLamore and David Edgerton in
      Miami, Florida. The original concept was simple: to offer customers
      great-tasting food at a reasonable price. The first Burger King restaurant
      quickly became popular for its flame-grilled burgers, which set us apart
      from our competitors. Over the years, we have expanded our menu and
      introduced new items, but our commitment to quality has remained
      unchanged.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide our customers with food they love, made with
      high-quality ingredients, and served by friendly and knowledgeable staff.
      We believe that everyone deserves a great meal, and we strive to make sure
      every visit to Burger King is a positive experience.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Our Food</h2>
    <p>
      At Burger King, we believe in using only the best ingredients to create
      our signature flame-grilled burgers, crispy fries, and refreshing
      beverages. Our Whopper, introduced in 1957, remains a customer favorite
      and a cornerstone of our menu. In addition to our classic offerings, we
      continuously innovate to bring new and exciting options to our guests,
      including plant-based alternatives, fresh salads, and tasty desserts.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Commitment to Quality</h2>
    <p>
      We take food quality seriously at Burger King. Our beef patties are 100%
      beef, free from fillers, preservatives, and additives. We source our
      ingredients from trusted suppliers and ensure that every meal meets our
      high standards for taste and safety. Our commitment to quality extends
      beyond our food to our packaging and sustainability practices.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Sustainability and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      As a global brand, we recognize our responsibility to the environment and
      the communities we serve. Burger King is committed to reducing our
      environmental footprint through various initiatives, including sustainable
      sourcing, energy-efficient practices, and waste reduction programs. We
      also support local communities through charitable partnerships and
      employee volunteer programs.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Innovation and Growth</h2>
    <p>
      Innovation has always been at the heart of Burger King. From the
      introduction of the drive-thru service in the 1970s to the launch of our
      mobile app and delivery service, we continuously seek new ways to enhance
      the customer experience. Our commitment to growth has also led us to
      expand into new markets, bringing the Burger King experience to more
      people around the world.
